Python List Manipulation Script
Overview
This Python script demonstrates basic list operations such as appending elements, inserting elements at a specific position, extending the list, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value.

Steps Performed
Create an Empty List:
An empty list called my_list is initialized.

Appending Elements:
The elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 are appended to my_list.

Inserting an Element:
The value 15 is inserted at the second position (index 1) of the list.

Extending the List:
The list is extended by adding another list [50, 60, 70] to my_list.

Removing the Last Element:
The last element in the list is removed using the pop() method.

Sorting the List:
The list is sorted in ascending order using the sort() method.

Finding the Index of a Value:
The index of the value 30 in the list is found and printed.
